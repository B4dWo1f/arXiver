# arXiver
In this repo I start my project to personalize arxiv. It should be able to extract in advance the papers relevant to me by checking out my behaviour for some time (and maybe also checking my bibliography?)

## Download arXiv
A simple spider should download daily all the arxiv's cond-mat new papers.

### To-Do
- [ ] Restructure the read functions. single responsibility!!
